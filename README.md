## 5. Usage

Effortless Book Information Retrieval: bookBase simplifies the process of obtaining information about any book title. Users can easily search for their favorite books and access details such as author, publication date, and a description.

Open Library Integration: Discover whether the searched book is available for download on Open Library.

Responsive Design: bookBase is optimized for various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Enjoy a consistent experience across different screen sizes.

User-Friendly Interface: Our intuitive and user-friendly interface ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience. The clean design and straightforward navigation make it easy for users to find the information they need.

- Google books API refers the ISBN data to the Open Library API, which then returns eBook Availability to the user to show whether there is an eBook available for digital borrowing from the Open Library site.
- eBook availability is colour-coded for user convenience and readability
- The user's search history is saved in a displayed container at the top of the page. This displays the user's whole search activity in one session. On page refresh, the user is shown a single entry that is their last search.
- The search history can be deleted by button press.

## 9. Project status

Future development ideas:

- Expanding information returned by Open Library, e.g. not only eBook Availability, but also providing a link to the eBook borrowing page
- Creating more models for various error events
- Turning the menu/nav bar hrefs into functioning links to other pages, e.g. Home, About, Contact Us
- Providing a fallback thumbnail for books with broken thumbnail links
- Providing placeholder text to notify user that information is missing or incomplete (e.g. where the ISBN isn't listed)
- Formatting the book list into cards for better readability
- Styling headings


Happy reading! ðŸ“š
